## Matrix Equality by Sum

This program generates two 3×3 matrices with random values from 1 to 10 and prints them.
It calculates the sum of elements for each matrix and compares them.
If the sums are equal, it prints that the matrices are equal; otherwise, it prints they are not.
Useful for practicing arrays, functions, and basic matrix operations in C++.
