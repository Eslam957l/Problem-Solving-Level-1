## Identity Matrix Check

This program defines a 3×3 matrix and prints it.
It checks whether the matrix is an identity matrix, where all diagonal elements are 1 and all off-diagonal elements are 0.
If the matrix meets this condition, it prints that it is an identity matrix; otherwise, it prints that it is not.
Useful for practicing arrays, nested loops, and conditional checks in C++.
