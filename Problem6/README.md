## Matrix Element wise Multiplication

This program generates two 3x3 matrices with random numbers from 1 to 10.  
It prints both matrices and then multiplies each element of the first matrix by the corresponding element in the second matrix.  
Finally, it prints the resulting matrix after element-wise multiplication.
