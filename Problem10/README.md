## Exact Matrix Equality

This program generates two 3×3 matrices with random values from 1 to 10 and prints them.
It compares each element of the two matrices to check if they are exactly equal.
If all corresponding elements match, it prints that the matrices are equal; otherwise, it prints they are not.
Useful for practicing arrays, nested loops, and function-based comparisons in C++.
