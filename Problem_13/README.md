## Sparse Matrix Check

This program prints a 3×3 matrix and checks whether it is a sparse matrix.
A sparse matrix is defined as having more than half of its elements equal to zero.
The program counts the zero elements and determines if the matrix is sparse or not.
Useful for practicing arrays, nested loops, and conditional logic in C++.
